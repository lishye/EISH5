# EISH5.com by Google AI Studio app

I have a domain is eish5.com
The inspiration for "EISH5" comes from Morse code (. .. ... .... .....), which consists entirely of dots.

Hence, I decided to create a Morse Code Translator website with the following features:

1. The website supports switching between Chinese and English languages.

2. It supports converting Morse code to text.

3. It supports converting text to Morse code.

4. It can emit telegraph sounds and control the screen to flash along with the telegraph sounds.
